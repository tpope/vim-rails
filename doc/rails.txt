==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*rails-introduction* *rails*

TextMate may be the latest craze, but Vim is forever.  This plugin offers the
following features for Ruby on Rails application development.

1. Automatically detects buffers containing files from Rails applications,
   and applies settings to those buffers (and only those buffers).  You can
   use an |autocommand| to apply your own custom settings as well.
   |rails-configuration|

2. Unintrusive.  It should only affect files in a Rails application; regular
   Ruby scripts are left untouched.  Even when enabled, the plugin should keep
   out of your way if you're not using its features.  (If you find a situation
   where this is not a case, contact the |rails-plugin-author|.)

3. Provides reasonable settings for working with Rails applications.  Rake is
   the 'makeprg' (and it always knows where your Rakefile is), 'shiftwidth'
   is 2, and 'path' includes an appropriate collection of directories from
   your application. |rails-options|

4. Easy navigation of the Rails directory structure.  |gf| considers context
   and knows about partials, fixtures, and much more.  |:Alternate| (easily
   mapped with |<Plug>RailsAlternate|) helps you jump from your view, to your
   helper, to your controller, to your test. |rails-navigation|

5. Partial extraction.  |:Partial| {file} replaces the desired range (ideally
   selected in visual line mode) with "render :partial => '{file}'", which is
   automatically created with the content you created.  The @{file} instance
   variable is replaced with the {file} local variable. |rails-partials|

6. Snippets.  (Just kidding.)

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION AND USAGE				*rails-installation*

If you have the zip file, extract it to vimfiles (Windows) or ~/.vim
(everything else).  You should have the following files: >
	plugin/rails.vim
	doc/rails.txt
See |add-local-help| for instructions on enabling the documentation.  In a
nutshell: >
	:helptags ~/.vim/doc

Whenever you edit a file in a Rails application, this plugin will be
automatically activated.  This sets various options and defines a few
buffer-specific commands.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					*rails-configuration*

Little configuration should need to be done; this plugin automatically detects
and adjusts Vim sensibly and subtly.  If you would like to set your own custom
Vim settings when ever a Rails file is loaded, you can use an autocmd like the
following in your vimrc: >
	autocmd User rails map <buffer> <LocalLeader>ra <Plug>RailsAlternate

A few global variables control the behavior of this plugin.  In general, they
can be enabled with lines line the following in your vimrc: >
	let g:rails_some_option=1
<
						*g:rails_loaded*
Do not load the plugin. For emergency use only. >
	let g:rails_loaded=1
<
						*g:rails_no_isfname*
Disables the changes to the 'isfname' option.  See |rails-'isfname'|.

						*g:rails_statusline*
Give a clue in the statusline when this plugin is enabled: >
	let g:rails_statusline=1
This requires that the current filetype is in your existing 'statusline'.
 
==============================================================================
MANAGED VIM OPTIONS			*rails-options*

The following options are set local to buffers where the plugin is active.

					*rails-'shiftwidth'*	*rails-'sw'*
					*rails-'softtabstop'*	*rails-'sts'*
					*rails-'expandtab'*	*rails-'et'*
A value of 2 is used for 'shiftwidth' (and 'softtabstop'), and 'expandtab' is
enabled.  This is a strong convention in Rails, so the conventional wisdom
that this is a user preference has been ignored.

					*rails-'path'*		*rails-'pa'*
All the relevant directories from your application are added to your 'path'.
This makes it easy to access a buried file: >
	:find blog_controller.rb
<
					*rails-'suffixesadd'*	*rails-'sua'*
This is filetype dependent, but typically includes .rb, .rhtml, and several
others.  This allows shortening the above example: >
	:find blog_controller
<
					*rails-'includeexpr'*	*rails-'inex'*
The 'include' and 'includeexpr' options are set to enable the magic described
in |rails-gf|.

					*rails-'isfname'*	*rails-'isf'*
The |rails-gf| feature is further enhanced by changing 'isfname'.
Unfortunately, this is a global option.  To compensate, the plugin attempts to
restore this option upon changing buffers.  If this causes problems for you,
enable the |g:rails_no_isfname| setting.  Also, please explain your problem to
the |rails-plugin-author|, so that it might be addressed in a future release.

					*rails-'makeprg'*	*rails-'mp'*
					*rails-'errorformat'*	*rails-'efm'*
Rake is used as the 'makeprg', so |:make| will work as expected.  Also, thanks
to the rubyunit compiler, 'errorformat' is set appropriately to handle your
tests.

					*rails-'filetype'*	*rails-'ft'*
The 'filetype' is sometimes adjusted for Rails files.  Most notably, *.rxml
and *.rjs are treated as Ruby files, and files that have been falsely
identified as Mason sources are changed back to ERuby files (but only when
they are part of a Rails application).

==============================================================================
NAVIGATION					*rails-navigation*

The 'path' has been modified to include all the best places to be.
>
	:find blog_controller
	:find book_test
<
						*rails-gf*
Use |gf|, |CTRL-W_f|, and |CTRL-W_gf| liberally, as 'includeexpr' has been
hacked to make them quite intelligent.

Example uses of |gf|, and where they might lead.
(* indicates cursor position)
>
	Pos*t.find(:first)
<	app/models/post.rb ~
>
	has_many :c*omments
<	app/models/comment.rb ~
>
	link_to "Home", :controller => :bl*og
<	app/controllers/blog_controller.rb ~
>
	<%= render :partial => 'sh*ared/sidebar' %>
<	app/views/shared/_sidebar.rhtml ~
>
	<%= stylesheet_link_tag :scaf*fold %>
<	public/stylesheets/scaffold.css ~

	class ApplicationController < ActionCont*roller::Base
<	.../action_controller/base.rb ~
>
	fixtures :pos*ts
<	test/fixtures/posts.yml ~
>
	layout :pri*nt
<	app/views/layouts/print.rhtml ~
>
	(In the Blog controller)
	def li*st
<	app/views/blog/list.rhtml ~

Suggestions for further contexts to consider are welcome.

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS					*rails-mappings*

There are no default mappings.

						*<Plug>RailsAlternate*
<Plug>RailsAlternate	Switch to the "alternate" file.  Typically this just
			adds or removes "_test" from the filename , but try it
			in lots of places, you may be surprised. >
				:map <Leader>ra <Plug>RailsAlternate

==============================================================================
COMMANDS					*rails-commands*

						*rails-:Cd*
:Cd [{directory}]	|:cd| to /path/to/railsapp/{directory}.

						*rails-:Lcd*
:Lcd [{directory}]	|:lcd| to /path/to/railsapp/{directory}.

						*rails-:Script*
:Script {script} {options}
			Call ruby script/{script} {options}.

						*rails-:Console*
:Console {options}	Start script/console.

						*rails-:Alternate*
:Alternate		Load the "alternate" file.  See
			|<Plug>RailsAlternate|.

						*rails-:Partial*
:[range]Partial [{controller}/]{name}	
			Create a {name} partial from [range] lines (default:
			current line).  See |rails-partials|.

						*rails-:Partial!*
:Partial!		Does not exist (yet).  You will have to manually
			delete an old partial before creating a new one.


==============================================================================
PARTIAL EXTRACTION				*rails-partials*

The |rails-:Partial| command can be used to extract a partial to a new file.

If this is your file, in app/views/blog/show.rhtml: >

  1	<div>
  2	  <h2><%= @post.title %></h2>
  3	  <p><%= @post.body %></p>
  4	</div>

And you issue this command: >

	:2,3Partial post

Your file will change to this: >

  1	<div>
  2	  <%= render :partial => 'post' %>
  3	</div>

And app/views/blog/_post.rhtml will now contain: >

  1	<h2><%= post.title %></h2>
  2	<p><%= post.body %></p>
<
The easiest way to choose what to extract is to use |linewise-visual| mode.
Then, a simple >
	:'<,'>Partial blog/post
will suffice. (Note the use of a controller name in this example.)
