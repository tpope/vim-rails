# rails.vim

Remember when everybody and their mother was using TextMate for Ruby on
Rails development?  Well if it wasn't for rails.vim, we'd still be in
that era.  So shut up and pay some respect.  And check out these
features:

* Easy navigation of the Rails directory structure.  `gf` considers
  context and knows about partials, fixtures, and much more.  There are
  two commands, `:A` (alternate) and `:R` (related) for easy jumping
  between files, including favorites like model to schema, template to
  helper, and controller to functional test.  Commands like `:Emodel`,
  `:Eview`, `:Econtroller`, are provided to `:edit` files by type, along
  with `S`, `V`, and `T` variants for `:split`, `:vsplit`, and
  `:tabedit`.  Throw a bang on the end (`:Emodel foo!`) to automatically
  create the file with the standard boilerplate if it doesn't exist.
  `:help rails-navigation`

* Enhanced syntax highlighting.  From `has_and_belongs_to_many` to
  `distance_of_time_in_words`, it's here.

* Interface to rake.  Use `:Rake` to run the current test, spec, or
  feature.  Use `:.Rake` to do a focused run of just the method,
  example, or scenario on the current line.  `:Rake` can also run
  arbitrary migrations, load individual fixtures, and more.
  `:help rails-rake`

* Interface to the `rails` command.  Generally, use `:Rails console` to
  call `rails console`.  Many commands have wrappers with additional features:
  `:Rgenerate controller Blog` generates a blog controller and loads the
  generated files into the quickfix list, and `:Rrunner` wraps `rails runner`
  and doubles as a direct test runner.  `:help rails-scripts`

* Partial and concern extraction.  In a view, `:Rextract {file}`
  replaces the desired range (typically selected in visual line mode)
  with `render '{file}'`, which is automatically created with your
  content.  In a model or controller, a concern is created, with the
  appropriate `include` declaration left behind.
  `:help rails-:Rextract`

* Fully customizable. Define "projections" at the global, app, or gem
  level to define navigation commands and override the alternate file,
  default rake task, syntax highlighting, abbreviations, and more.
  `:help rails-projections`.

* Integration with other plugins.  If
  [dbext.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=356) is
  installed, it will be transparently configured to reflect
  `database.yml`.  Users of
  [abolish.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-abolish) get pluralize and
  tableize coercions, and users of
  [bundler.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-bundler) get a smattering of
  features.  `:help rails-integration`

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-rails.git
    git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-bundler.git

You don't strictly need [bundler.vim][], but it helps.

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help rails`.

## Tutor

If you prefer learning by doing, make sure to checkout the included tutor.

It will let you interact with a sample Rails application, and will guide you
through some of the most useful commands rails.vim has to offer.

To start the tutor, run:

```
./vim-rails-tutor
```

**Note:** the executable above will run `bundle install` in order to install
all gems necessary to run the sample app and its tests.

## FAQ

> I installed the plugin and started Vim.  Why does only the `:Rails`
> command exist?

This plugin cares about the current file, not the current working
directory.  Edit a file from a Rails application.

> I opened a new tab.  Why does only the `:Rails` command exist?

This plugin cares about the current file, not the current working
directory.  Edit a file from a Rails application.  You can use the `:RT`
family of commands to open a new tab and edit a file at the same time.

> Can I use rails.vim to edit Rails engines?

It's not supported, but if you `touch config/environment.rb` in the root
of the engine, things should mostly work.

> Can I use rails.vim to edit other Ruby projects?

I wrote [rake.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rake) for exactly that
purpose.  It activates for any project with a `Rakefile` that's not a
Rails application.

> What Rails versions are supported?

All of them, although you may notice a few minor breakages if you dip below
3.0.  A few features like syntax highlighting tend to reflect the latest
version only.

> Didn't rails.vim used to handle indent settings?

It got yanked after increasing contention over JavaScript.  Check out
[sleuth.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sleuth).
